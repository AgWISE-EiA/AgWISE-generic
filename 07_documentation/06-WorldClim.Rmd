## Weather and climate: WorldClim{.unnumbered}

WorldClim is a database of high spatial resolution global weather and climate data. These data can be used for mapping and spatial modeling. The data are provided for use in research and related activities; and some specialized skill and knowledge is needed to use them. For technical detailes refer to [Fick and Hijmans, 2017)(https://rmets.onlinelibrary.wiley.com/doi/abs/10.1002/joc.5086)
