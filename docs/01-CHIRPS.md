## Weather and climate: CHIRPS{.unnumbered}

Climate Hazards Group InfraRed Precipitation with Station data (CHIRPS) is a 35-plus year quasi-global rainfall data set. Spanning 50S-50N (and all longitudes) and ranging from 1981 to near-present, CHIRPS incorporates our in-house climatology, CHPclim, 0.05 degree resolution satellite imagery, and in-situ station data to create gridded rainfall time series for trend analysis and seasonal drought monitoring. To learn more about CHIRPS, read [Funk et al. (2015)](https://www.nature.com/articles/sdata201566).
