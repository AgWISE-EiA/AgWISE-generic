AgWISE builds on the AKILIMO decision support tool, and through the TRANSFORM Team of the Excellence in Agronomy CGIAR Initiative is being developed to address the demand from many agronomic advisory use cases across the globe.

Spanning 50S-50N (and all longitudes) and ranging from 1981 to near-present, CHIRPS incorporates our in-house climatology, CHPclim, 0.05 degree resolution satellite imagery, and in-situ station data to create gridded rainfall time series for trend analysis and seasonal drought monitoring. To learn more about CHIRPS, read Funk et al. (2015).
