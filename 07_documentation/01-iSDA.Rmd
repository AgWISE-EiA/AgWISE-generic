## Soils: iSDA{.unnumbered}

iSDA soil is the first field-level soil map for Africa, with 20+ soil properties predicted at 30m resolution for the entire continent. Our development process applies predictive machine learning technology using data from over 130,000 soil samples, much of it based on years of research by the African Soil Information Service (AfSIS) and other soil data resources.
