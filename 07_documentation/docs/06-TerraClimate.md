## Weather and climate: TerraClimate{.unnumbered}

TerraClimate is a dataset of monthly climate and climatic water balance for global terrestrial surfaces from 1958-2019. These data provide important inputs for ecological and hydrological studies at global scales that require high spatial resolution and time-varying data. All data have monthly temporal resolution and a ~4-km (1/24th degree) spatial resolution. The data cover the period from 1958-2020. We plan to update these data periodically (annually).
